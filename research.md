*Cohesion or illusion? Losing funds and European sentiment* \
with Marco Di Cataldo

Does losing access to European funding lower European sentiment? This
paper examines the causal impact of losing EU Cohesion Policy funding on
regional European sentiment, measured through voting behavior in European
Parliament elections. Exploiting the staggered timing of regions losing
the less developed (convergence) status, we apply difference-in-differences
estimators to identify the effect of funding cuts. Our findings indicate that
regions experiencing funding losses exhibit a significant decline in support for
pro-EU mainstream parties, coupled with increased votes for opposition and
anti-establishment parties. These political shifts are particularly pronounced
in cohorts losing status in 2000 and 2007, and are accompanied by adverse
economic outcomes such as reduced GDP and increased unemployment. This
study highlights the political consequences of cohesion funding reductions
and underscores the importance of cautious policymaking regarding EU
financial allocations. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to causally
examine how losing EU funding affects public sentiment toward the EU.
